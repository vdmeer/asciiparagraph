=== Conditional line breaks


With all excessive white spaces being removed, conditional line breaks in a paragraph need to be done using a markup.
The implementation recognizes the two HTML line break markups `<br>` and `<br />`.

The example below adds text to a paragraph with excessive white spaces (being removed) and conditional line breaks (being translated into line breaks).

The lines 1 and 2 add a conditional line break as `<br>` and `<br />` respectively.
They appear as individual lines.
The third line has an excessive line break, which will be removed, resulting in a single line.

The resulting output:

line 1                             
line 2                             
line three still line three
