=== Renderer

The actual rendering of a paragraph is realized by special render objects (i.e. it's not done in the paragraph or its context).
A paragraph can be rendered in two different ways:

. call the provided render methods on the paragraph object itself
. use a specialized render object

No changes are made to the paragraph text or any context settings by any render operation.
All required text being processed and calculations being made will happen inside the renderer.

The render methods on the paragraph allow to render it (a) to the width set in the context or (b) to an overall required width.
The first option is the most simple one: fill paragraph with text, set width on context, render.
The second option can be used by other applications, for instance a table, to get a paragraph of required width.

For any other render operations use the provided standard renderer or create your own render object.
The default renderer does currently provide render methods to different width with calculations provided by the context.

Note: coming soon: 
It also provides render methods that use their own context (i.e. ignore the context set in the paragraph).
This allows for extremely flexibility in using the paragraph in many different scenarios.
