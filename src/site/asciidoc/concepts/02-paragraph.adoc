=== Paragraph

A paragraph is a collection of text strings.
The strings are processed as follows:

* add text to the paragraph, multiple times if required
* the paragraph will separate each added text using a space
* for rendering a paragraph, all excessive white spaces will be removed
  ** tabulators (converted to spaces),
  ** more than one consecutive space,
  ** line feed,
  ** carriage return, and
  ** line feed and carriage return.

==== Format of a paragraph

Paragraphs can be formatted using a number of special formats.
Currently implemented are

* First line - an indentation for the first line of the paragraph
* Hanging paragraph - an indentation for everything but the first line
* Dropped capital letter - a large capital letter for the first character of the first sentence spanning multiple lines


==== Text alignment

Text in the paragraph can be aligned in multiple different ways:

* align left (open ended right site)
* align right (open ended left site)
* centered (all lines centered)
* justified (all line justified)
* justified with last line left aligned
* justified with last line right aligned 


==== Text padding

All lines will use padding to create a paragraph with equal length of each line.
The padding on the left and the right depends on the text alignment:

- align left: no padding left (all lines bound), padding on the right
- align right: no padding on the right (all lines bound), padding on the right
- centered: padding on both sides of each line
- justified: no padding at all, each line starts and finishes with a word (or single character)
- justified last line left align: padding only for the last line, on the right site
- justified last line right align: padding only for the last line, on the left site

The characters being used for padding can be set separately, so that each site of a line gets a different padding character.


==== In-text white spaces

With all excessive white spaces removed, each line only contains single blanks.
The exception to this rule are all justified paragraphs (here extra white spaces are added to give the impression of a justified paragraph).

The implementation allows to change the character used for in-text white spaces from the default (a blank) to any other character.


==== Start and end strings

Each line of a paragraph can be started and terminated by a specific (different or identical) string.
These strings are outside the text area, i.e. no special formatting is done on those strings.


==== Margins

A paragraph has several margins for the left and right sides as well as for top and bottom.
Each margin can be set - the width for let/right side margins and the height for top and bottom margins.
Additionally, a character can be set for left/right margins (the same or different characters for each side).


==== Frame

A paragraph can also be framed. A frame is

* a line above the paragraph,
* borders for each line of the paragraph (on the left and right side),
* and a line at the bottom of of the paragraph.

The frame is set as a frame theme.
A number of those themes are provided in the `skb-interfaces` package.
New themes can be created very easily, using ASCII and/or UTF-8 characters.
